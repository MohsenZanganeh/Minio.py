# Minio

i used minio to manage my files to download and upload them from minio. i figured out `minio` is one of the best thing that allow you to upload your file nicely.

# running project
# First
go to env file and change the `SERVER_URL` to your ip address.

# Second
install The docker on your system


# Third
open a command on the project's path

# Forth
write on command `docker-compose up` and press `Enter`

# Fifth
go to a browser and search for this address `http://<your ip address>:5002/api/docs/`

# Finally you can use project
